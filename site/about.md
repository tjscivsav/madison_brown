para1: Ice cream can mean a lot of different things but at Madison Brown it
  stands for family, friends, and community. Over the years our family has
  enjoyed countless ice cream trips which still serve as some of our fondest
  memories. With so many wonderful experiences we wondered how we could continue
  to share our passion with those we love most, and thus Madison Brown was born.
  Named after one of our family members, we began to make flavors the same way
  we made memories - over time and together. Each adding our insights and
  tasting endless combinations we landed on our six trademark flavors that
  ensured the classics were perfect with little personalized touches throughout
  the ingredient
para2: From there we began giving it to our friends and community and realized
  that not only could we create our own happiness, we could           share it.
  We knew that this was how we would spread joy, create           memories, and
  bring people together. Therefore, you can count on           Madison Brown to
  continue to find ways to give back to the communities who create and inspire
  usâ€¦ because some things are meant for sharing.
