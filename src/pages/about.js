          stands for family, friends, and community. Over the years our family
          has enjoyed countless ice cream trips which still serve as some of our
          fondest memories. With so many wonderful experiences we wondered how
          we could continue to share our passion with those we love most, and
          thus Madison Brown was born. Named after one of our family members, we
          began to make flavors the same way we made memories - over time and
          together. Each adding our insights and tasting endless combinations we
          landed on our six trademark flavors that ensured the classics were
          perfect with little personalized touches throughout the ingredients.`}
